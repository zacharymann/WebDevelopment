// ALERT and PROMPT

//Used to test that the HTML and JS files are connected/linked
console.log("Hello from the JS File (AKA the other side)!");

// Alert
alert("Hello!")

// Prompt
prompt("Welcome to the page. What is your name?")

alert ("Cool Name")

// Prompt returns the user's response which can be set as a value for a variable

// console.log(prompt ("What is your favorite color?")); This is another way of writing this.
const favColor = prompt("What is your favorite color?")

alert(`Your favorite color is ${favColor}`);

CREATE REACT APP

Create React App is a simple command line (AKA Terminal)  command to run which sets up everything we need to start creating a React Web App

The command to run is...

npx create-react-app app-name

NOTE: The command will create a folder with all the React features inside of the folder that command is run inside of. Also, what put after "create-react-app"(In this case app-name) will be the name of the created folder. Finally it is common practice to use all lowercase letters seperated by hyphens (Example: my-app)

Files in a create-react-app App...

the "src" folder is where the new components are created. Each file should contain a single component with the same name as the file.

Commands to start the React app after it has been created...

cd app-name
npm start
